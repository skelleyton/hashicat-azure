# We're using a little trick here so we can run the provisioner without
# destroying the VM. Do not do this in production.

# If you need ongoing management (Day N) of your virtual machines a tool such
# as Chef or Puppet is a better choice. These tools track the state of
# individual files and can keep them in the correct configuration.

# Here we do the following steps:
# Sync everything in files/ to the remote VM.
# Set up some environment variables for our script.
# Add execute permissions to our scripts.
# Run the deploy_app.sh script.
